# OwnVPN

Simple script to deploy your own VPN server.


# PPTP
Only MS-CHAP v2 with MPPE-128 encryption is allowed.

# Note that PPTP is NOT recommended for transmission secret data, because all strong PPTP authentication algorithms have been already hacked.

# INSTALLATION

Download: "git clone https://github.com/coderastic/ownvpn.git"

then run "sudo ./ownvpn/PPTP/install.sh"

More VPN protocols will be added soon.
